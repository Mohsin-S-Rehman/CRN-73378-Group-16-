MTK Techstore is a concept for an E-Commerce website that allows clients the ability to Purchase electronics vie the internet. This concept was made for our SOFE 2720U final project based on an online shopping system. The files contained within this git-hub documents will inform the viewer of how we intended for the system to work, the design of the system, the requirements we would like it to meet, and more. The Website prototype was Designed with HTML, SQL, and PHP and is intended to be developed further in the future.
